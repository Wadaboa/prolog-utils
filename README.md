# Prolog utilities

## Source files

* Inside `utils.pl` you can find some Prolog examples, exercises and utilities,
regarding data structures like lists, sets, queues and binary trees.
* Inside `nqueens.pl` you can find two implementations of the n-queens problem,
where the first one uses only LP principles, while the second one uses CLP predicates.
* Inside `meta.pl` you can find implementations of meta-interpreters and the use of various meta-predicates.
Also grammar parsers and Definite Clause Grammar parsers have been tested.
